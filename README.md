# PokePicker

This repository contains the `Poke_picker.ipynb` notebook, which is designed for identifying Pokémon based on their descriptions. This project leverages machine learning techniques to match descriptions of Pokémon to the correct species.

## Features

- **Pokémon Identification**: The model aims to identify various Pokémon by analyzing textual descriptions.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Uses datasets or models from Hugging Face to fine-tune the identification process.
- **Data Processing**: The notebook includes code for preprocessing Pokémon descriptions and inputting them into the model.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Torch
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas numpy jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poke-picker.git
    cd poke-picker
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Poke_picker.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data and train or fine-tune the Pokémon identification model.

## Dataset

The project utilizes Pokémon descriptions, which can be sourced from available datasets on Hugging Face. Make sure to preprocess the data to fit the model’s input requirements.

## Fine-Tuning

The model used in this notebook can be fine-tuned with a dataset of Pokémon descriptions to improve accuracy. The notebook provides detailed steps on how to perform this fine-tuning process.

## Results

The notebook includes code to evaluate the performance of the Pokémon identifier. After running the notebook, you will be able to see the accuracy of the model and how well it can classify Pokémon based on their descriptions.
